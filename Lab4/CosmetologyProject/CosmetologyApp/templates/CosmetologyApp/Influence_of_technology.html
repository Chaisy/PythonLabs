<article style="width:1000px; margin:auto">
<p>We are living in an era of technology. Technology makes humans' life facile. Day by day we can see new
    inventions and innovations in every field due to technology.
    Practically every industry has been significantly impacted by technology. The beauty industry has seen a
    technological shift over the past 10 years that has increased the effectiveness of business management,
    communication, and marketing tasks. Following the increased adoption of technology across a wide range of corporate
    operations, the sector is currently moving in the direction of higher revenues.</p>

    <h2 id="connection">Connection Between Beauty And Technology</h2>
    <p>So what is the relationship between technology and beauty? Technology has been used in the beauty and cosmetic
        sector as a result of consumer dissatisfaction with conventional beauty products and the need for innovative
        alternatives. The way we view beauty and wellness therapies today is changing as a result of the growing usage
        of devices and tools in daily skincare regimens because they not only work well but also produce results quickly.</p>
    <p>The development of the beauty business to where it is today has been greatly aided by technology. With the
        release of apps like Techkon's Catch Your Beauty Tone and L'Or√©al's Makeup Genius, customers may now engage with
        cosmetics and skin care items online. The former uses facial mapping technologies to transform a smartphone into
        a virtual mirror that lets users test out different makeup looks while also having share features connected to
        various social networks. Several people complain that finding the proper coloration of foundation for her pores
        and skin is an enormous mission that regularly requires trial and mistake. Businesses try a unique technique to
        this hassle with AI replacing traditional retail interactions.
