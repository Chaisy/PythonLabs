Dr. Livesey said, "The log cabin is not visible from the ship? They must be aiming at a flag. We must load a flag adwance."
The word "rum" and the word "death" mean the same thing to you.
Where's the map, Billy?

Once upon a time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.
 Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when
 it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going..!
 The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.
 "What a mess!", her two stepsisters laughed.  And that is why they called her "Cinderella".
One day, big news came to town.
The King and Queen were going to have a ball!  It was time for the Prince to find a bride.
All the young ladies in the land were invited to come...  They were wild with joy!? They would wear their most
beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!
At Cinderellaâ€™s house, she now had extra work to do.  She had to make two brand-new gowns for her step-sisters.
"Faster!", shouted one step-sister.
"You call that a dress?"
but what do you mean....?
